This repository contains some tools for extracting the historical energy usage
from the originenergy.com.au website

Unfortunately, the current origin energy website only offers per-day
data, which is pretty much useless for using to determine usage patterns.
They have also "improved" the website, so the v3 exporter no longer works.

They do have the option to download your data as a CSV, but it is bill totals
data and not daily usage data, so again not useful.

Finally, they do have a "Request my usage data" option, but it takes up to 20
business days for them to provide that data - and it is unclear what the
contents are.

There are three exporters included:
* v1 - an exporter for the original originenergy beta website.
    Do not use.

* v2 - Only partially working exporter for the SAP version of the website
    Do not use.

* v3 - Exporter for a previous version of the Origin Energy Website

* export-power-usage - exporter for the current originenergy website.

There is one reporting tool, converting the raw json data into graphable
whitespace-separated data

* power-json2tsv
